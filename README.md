Open the project within IntellIJ IDEA for the best experience, the stonecutter system has been known to cause issues with IDEs such as Eclipse and VSCode. Alternatively you can just use GitHub's web interface if you're contributing translations.

Once you've got the project **fully imported** you can use the "Set active project to xxxx" tasks to switch between fabric, neoforge and other Minecraft versions.

When you are finished with your changes, **please run the `"Reset Active Project"` and `chiseledBuild` tasks before making a commit!**
